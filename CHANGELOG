v3.0b1 - 2009 May 25
  + updated to use v3 of the XML-RPC API to communicate with the Shotgun server
  + the "limit" option for find() now works fully
  + errors from the server are now raised as xml-rpc Fault exceptions (previously just wrote the error into the
    results, and you had to check for it explicitly -- which most people didn't do, so they didn't see the errors)
