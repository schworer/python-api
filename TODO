TODO

 - add a configurable timeout duration (python xml-rpc lib never times out by default)
 - include a native python https implementation, when native https is not available (e.g. maya's python)
 - convert duration fields to/from a native python object?
 - make file fields an http link to the file
 - add logging functionality
 - add scrubbing to text data sent to server to make sure it is all valid unicode
 - support removing thumbnails / files (can only create or replace them now)
